Hey there! I'm a senior at Arizona State studying Computer Science and Math. In my free time, I enjoy rowing, cooking new dishes from around the world, writing about whatever music I'm listening to at the moment [(check out my Last.fm!)](https://www.last.fm/user/batouttahellcat), and watching basketball games---go Suns! Aside from that, photography is another one of my passions; as an avid Fuji user, new landscapes are but a dream.
