Hey there! My name's Harsha and I code well-designed systems for a living; before this, I studied Math and Computer Science at Arizona State. In my free time, I enjoy rowing, cooking new dishes from around the world, and writing about whatever music I'm listening to at the moment [(check out my Last.fm!)](https://www.last.fm/user/batouttahellcat). Photography's another one of my passions---as an avid Fuji user, new landscapes are but a dream.
