I usually shoot my photos on a Fuji. It's a rewarding endeavor; my portfolio has a heavy skew towards nature.

import Image from "next/image";
import imageLoader from '../lib/imageLoader'

<Image
  loader={imageLoader}
  src="https://i.ibb.co/ZgQqMyk/bird-roof-min.jpg"
  alt="Mourning Dove perched on a rooftop during golden hour in Phoenix, May 2022"
  className="next-image"
  width={0}
  height={0}
  sizes="100vw"
  style={{
      width: '100%',
      height: 'auto',
  }}
  priority
/>

Music helps to keep my rhythm in life, on the other hand. Here are the albums I listened to the most in 2023:
