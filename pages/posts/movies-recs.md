# Movie Recs

## Preface
Nighttime, the dark hour solely belonging to the likes of both cats and owls, has a special place in my heart. I used to stay up irresponsibly late during my formative years watching whatever cinema I could find, all the while juggling assignments and responsibilities that lay within my grasp. The quietness and solitude represented a distinct break from daily wear and toil. An eden of sorts. Moving onwards through college, where I learned to own my time, and now in the world where anything could happen, I have learned to appreciate this simple pleasure. It moves beyond the world of human possibility and into the plane of immortality far from our grasp but there, neither staid nor placid, on the silver screen. Like fire to the primeval mind, like stone to nimble fingers, film represents man's inalienable ambition born unto itself yet again.

Though I used to hear the eerie hoots of brooding owls and transient meows of precocious cats peering in from the dense foliage of my desert backyard day on day, night was, and still, remains for the movies and I. There are flaws in this visage. Bad movies, lurking in the shadows, will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth as a waste of your precious time. And I ran like hell from that. At some point you'll learn to accept that there's an equal opposite for every supposed waste of your time. To carve out a slice of the night, that escape without a face, from even the worst that lay in the light of day, some sickly-sweet reward awaits in a quality experience. Like death and taxes, this is cinema!
