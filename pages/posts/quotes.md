# An Assortment of Quotes

Lines that stuck out to me while reading, provided without context nor explanation:

> "My soul grazes like a lamb on the beauty of indrawn tides."
> 
> Tom Wingo (**The Prince of Tides**, Pat Conroy)

> "...There are only two or three human stories, and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before; like the larks in this country, that have been singing the same five notes over for thousands of years.”
>
> Carl Linstrum (**O Pioneers**, Willa Cather)
