Hey there! My name's Harsha and I design efficient algorithms for a living; before this, I got my undergrad degrees in Math and Computer Science at Arizona State.

In my free time, I enjoy rowing, cooking new dishes from around the world, and writing about whatever music I'm listening to at the moment [(check out my Last.fm!)](https://www.last.fm/user/batouttahellcat).
